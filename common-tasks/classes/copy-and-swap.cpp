// Implement the assignment operator with strong exception safety.
//
// The copy-and-swap idiom identifies that we can implement a
// classes copy/move assignment operators in terms of its
// copy/move constructor and achieve strong exception safety.
//
// The class `foo`, on [10-48], has an implementation similar to the
// [rule of five](/patterns/rule-of-five.html), yet its copy and
// move assignment operators have been replaced with a single
// assignment operator on [27-32]. This assignment operator takes its
// argument by value, making use of the existing copy and move
// constructor implementations.
//
// To implement the assignment operator, we simply need to swap the
// contents of `*this` and the argument, `other`. When `other` goes
// out of scope at the end of the function, it will destroy any
// resources that were originally associated with the current object.
//
// To achieve this, we define a `swap` function for our class on
// [39-44], which itself calls `swap` on the class's members ([43]).
// We use a using-declaration on [41] to allow `swap` to be found
// via [argument-dependent lookup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument-dependent_name_lookup)
// before using `std::swap` &mdash; this is not strictly necessary
// in our case, because we are only swapping a pointer, but is good
// practice in general. Our assignment operator then simply swaps
// `*this` with `other` on [29].
//
// The copy-and-swap idiom has inherent strong exception safety
// because all allocations (if any) occur when copying into the
// `other` argument, before any changes have been made to `*this`.
// It is generally, however, less optimized than a more custom
// implementation of the assignment operators.
//
// **Note**: We can typically avoid manual memory management and
// having to write the copy/move constructors, assignment operators,
// and destructor entirely by using the
// [rule of zero](/patterns/rule-of-zero.html)
